# Unity-Force-Field-Effect

If you are interested in **force field effect**, you can search **FORCE FIELD in Unity - SHADER GRAPH**. It's a video tutorial by **Brackeys**, and here is the [Youtube Link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NiOGWZXBg4Y).

The tutorial is cool, but the code generated by shader graph is not easy to read.

My version is a handwriting one for **Standard Pipeline** and also support **back face intersecting detection**.

My version is just an example, you can use it everywhere you want.
